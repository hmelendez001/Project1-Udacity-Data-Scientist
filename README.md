# Project1-Udacity-Data-Scientist
As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is project one of the program. This project involves a Jupyter Notebook analysis of a dataset I selected from Kaggle that shows Real Estate Data for a year's worth of properties sold on the NYC real estate market, found at: https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales.

In this analysis I employ the CRISP-DM process to answer the following three questions:

1. Does Manhattan sales trend differently than other boroughs, and if so, how? 
2. Are older buildings selling better than newer buildings?
3. Are bigger spaces more likely to sell in any particular neighborhood?
